<h3>How to contribute?</h3>

NOTE: Organization repo is whatever repo you are trying to contribute to/fork.
Getting Started:
1. Fork the repository that you wish to contribute to into your own profile
2. `git clone HTTPS_URL` your fork of the repository, where the HTTPS_URL can be found on the clone button on your fork.
3. The file should have downloaded!
4. Type in ‘git remote add upstream HTTPS_URL_ORGANIZATION’ where the HTTPS_URL_ORGANIZATION is the organization repository link (found on the clone button)
5. When you write git remote -v, you should see the following:
```origin	https://github.com/OussamaSaoudi/Documentation.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/OussamaSaoudi/Documentation.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/orate-io/Documentation.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/orate-io/Documentation.git (push)
```
Where instead of OussamaSaoudi it will be your GitHub profile nameInstead of Documentation, it may be some other repo under the orate-io organization.
Submitting your first commit:
1. Write your code
2. Add your work to be tracked by typing into your shell `git add *`
3. Commit your work by typing in `git commit -s`. The `-s` flag adds your signature to the commit so we know who write the code.
4. Push the work to the branch on your fork by typing `git push`
5. Now you are ready to submit your pull request! Go to GitHub, and navigate to your branch. On the top of the page, there should be a button that allows you to submit a pull request.
6. Submit it and wait for a developer to come check your work. If it is up to standards and is a meaningful contribution, it will be sent into the main branch.
